# CongoAfricanGreys.com — Project Guide

## Working Directory
- Site content (markdown): `site/content/`
- Site archive (static HTML): `archive/simply-static-1-1775169284.zip`
- Deploy: GitHub Actions → Cloudflare Pages (auto on push to main)
- Domain: `congoafricangreys.com`

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- **Design Context — READ FIRST (applies to EVERY agent, skill, and task)** — Before any design, content, page, or component work, you MUST read the two brand-context files at the repo root: **`PRODUCT.md`** (strategic: register, users, brand personality, anti-references, design principles, accessibility bar) and **`DESIGN.md`** (visual: locked palette + `--clay-ink`/`--clay-text` AA variants, typography, components, layout, motion, iconography). They are the single source of truth for *who/what/why* and *how it looks*, and the `/impeccable` skill auto-loads them. Treat them as binding alongside `docs/design.md`; if they ever conflict with older docs, surface it rather than guessing. Do not produce brand/visual output without having consulted them this session.
- **Preview before apply** — Any page redesign MUST be previewed and approved before writing to site files.
- **Same content** — Redesigns never add or remove page content. Visual layer only.
- **Confidence Gate** — ≥97% confidence required before writing any site file. If below: stop, state uncertainty, ask.
- **CITES Awareness** — African Greys are CITES **Appendix I** (uplisted from Appendix II at CoP17, effective Jan 2017) and IUCN Endangered (Congo) / Vulnerable (Timneh). Never imply illegal/wild-caught trade. All birds are **captive-bred in the USA** with full documentation — captive-bred Appendix-I birds are legal to own and transfer domestically with proper paperwork. (Corrected from "Appendix II" per World Parrot Trust, 2026-05-29 homepage audit.)
- **src/pages is deployed** — All HTML page edits MUST go to `src/pages/<slug>/index.html` or `src/pages/<slug>/index.astro`. The `site/content/` directory is a staging area; it does NOT get built directly. If both exist, `src/pages/` is authoritative.
- **Always commit + push after build** — After any agent or skill completes a build/edit, commit and `git push` immediately. Push = deploy (GitHub Actions → Cloudflare Pages, auto on push to `main`). Do not leave finished work uncommitted or unpushed. Applies to all agents.
- **Recommend + Why (ALWAYS) — applies to every agent, skill, and task** — Whenever you present the user options or choices (meta variants, keyword swaps, design directions, components, A/B picks, section placements — anything), you MUST: (1) mark exactly one option **(Recommended)**; (2) explain WHY, grounded in real data (GSC, competitors, the codebase) — never "feelings" or vague preference; (3) stay honest by naming the trade-off/downside of the recommended pick too. In `AskUserQuestion`, put the recommended option first and append "(Recommended)" to its label. Output that lists options without a reasoned recommendation is incomplete.

## Site Model
Transactional + informational, modeled after MaltipoosForsale.com (`/Users/apple/Downloads/MFS/`).
- **Transactional:** "african grey parrot for sale [state]" → inquiry form submissions
- **Informational:** care guides, species guides, health, training, comparison pages
- **Two variants:** Congo African Grey (CAG) vs Timneh African Grey (TAG)

## Phase 1 — Competitor Intelligence (Complete ✓)

### Agents
- `.claude/agents/cag-competitor-registry.md` — discovers + registers 30 competitors; run first
- `.claude/agents/cag-competitor-intel.md` — deep multi-metric analysis; single or --all mode
- `.claude/agents/cag-rank-tracker.md` — weekly monitoring; runs every Sunday

All three steps completed — outputs in `docs/research/` and `data/competitors.json`.

## Phase 2 — Full Agent System (Active)

### Model Tiers
All 65 agents are assigned to a 4-tier model system (Opus 4.8 / Opus 4.7 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5) with per-tier effort levels, driven by `data/agent-registry.json`. Each agent's frontmatter carries `model:`, `effort:`, `dynamic_workflow:`. See `docs/reference/WORKFLOW.md §Model Tier System`. Dynamic Workflow routing is active on the 3 orchestrators (content-architect, structure-architect, batch-rebuilder). To change models site-wide: edit the registry → `python3 scripts/apply_model_tiers.py` → `bash scripts/verify_model_tiers.sh`.

## Phase 2 Workflow

See `docs/reference/WORKFLOW.md` for the authoritative sprint-based workflow.

### Sprint Order (Quick Reference)
1. **Sprint 0** — Intelligence: `competitor-registry` → `competitor-intel --all` → `gsc-analytics` → `llm-keyword-intel`
1.5. **Sprint 0.5** — Session Orientation: `grill-me` skill (after Sprint 0 Gate passes — needs gap matrix + top-pages)
2. **Sprint 1** — Architecture: `structure-architect` → `competitive-keyword-gap` → `hub-builder` → `content-architect`
3. **Sprint 2** — Content: `content-audit` → **Section Map + Component Gate** → `angle-agent` → `paa-agent` → writer → `faq-agent` → `section-builder`
4. **Sprint 3** — AEO/GEO Gate: `keyword-verifier` → `meta-description` → `external-link` → `trust-signals`
5. **Sprint 4** — Technical: `accessibility-fixer` → `performance-fixer` → `canonical-fixer` → `footer-standardizer`
6. **Sprint 5** — Deploy: `git push` → `deploy-verifier` → `redirect-manager` → `sitemap-agent`
7. **Continuous** — Weekly/monthly/quarterly monitoring loops (see WORKFLOW.md §8)

### Phase 2 Setup History
Transfer and adapt all MFS agents + skills for African Grey domain.
- MFS project: `/Users/apple/Downloads/MFS/`
- Skills land in: `skills/`
- Domain-agnostic agents copy quickly; domain-specific agents need full rewrite

## Design System & Component Rules

### Design System v2 — "Terracotta Warmth" + Direction D "Modern Editorial" (active theme)

Active design system: `docs/design.md` (master reference) + `docs/design-system/README.md` (full narrative spec).
**Active visual theme (site default): Direction D "Modern Editorial"** — `skills/cag-direction-d-theme.md`, implemented in `src/styles/direction-d.css` + `body.theme-d`. It refines Terracotta Warmth (same locked palette + clay pill) with Newsreader serif headings and IBM Plex Sans body, and is inherited by every page through BaseLayout. Do NOT re-implement it per page.

**Non-Negotiable Design Rules — enforced on every page build and rebuild:**
1. **Colors:** Three anchors only — Forest Green `#2D6A4F` (nav/headers), Clay `#e8604c` (all CTAs/buttons), Cream `#faf7f4` (page surface). `--gold` MUST always equal `--clay`. (Direction D does NOT change the palette.)
   - **WCAG AA contrast variants (2026-06-03 — do NOT revert):** `#e8604c` only clears AA as *large* text/fill (3.38:1 white). For accessibility, solid clay **button fills** render `--color-clay-ink #c8472f` (white text 4.78:1, via a global `.bg-clay` rule in `global.css`), and **clay as small readable text** (inline links, eyebrows, form prices) renders `#b04228` (4.5:1+ on light). Brand identity token `--clay #e8604c` is unchanged; it still applies to tints, large display, and clay text **on dark/green** (hero "Trust" accent, dark testimonial chips — kept bright via `.home-d` exceptions). See `DESIGN.md` §Color.
2. **Type:** Direction D is live → **Newsreader** serif for ALL headlines (H1–H6) and **IBM Plex Sans** for ALL body/labels/buttons, applied globally via `body.theme-d`. Keep using the `font-lora`/`font-sora` utility classes in markup — `direction-d.css` restyles them automatically; Lora/Sora remain the token-level fallback. Do not hard-code `font-family` on elements to fight the theme.
3. **Buttons:** Primary CTA = clay pill, `border-radius: 50px`. This is the brand signature. Form submit buttons only use `border-radius: 12px`.
4. **Cards:** 20px radius, 1px `--border`, warm shadow, white surface. Info cards use green header band.
5. **Shadows:** Always warm-tinted `rgba(60,30,10,…)`. Never neutral grey.
6. **Motion:** Max 0.2s transitions. No bounce, no parallax, no auto-playing video.
7. **Icons = line-icon SVGs, NOT emoji** (site-wide sweep 2026-06-03, commit `9ff570f`; full spec in `DESIGN.md §Iconography`). Use inline Feather-style SVGs (`width/height="1em"`, `stroke="currentColor"`) — map + transform in `scripts/emoji_to_icons.py`. The former canonical emoji set (📞 ✉️ 📍 🕐 ✈️ 🚗 ✅) is now line icons (✅ → green `#2D6A4F` check-circle). KEEP only the text glyphs ✔ ✗ ★ (list/rating markers). One per element. Banned: 🎉 🔥 🚀 and any colorful pictograph emoji. **Render rule:** a data-array icon rendered via `{x.icon}` must use `set:html`, then verify `grep -rl "&lt;svg" dist/` is empty.
   - **African Grey bird icon — NEVER use 🦜** (generic green parrot, NOT an African Grey). Use custom images:
     - Congo African Grey: `<img src="/emoji/cag-congo.png" alt="Congo African Grey" class="cag-emoji" loading="lazy">`
     - Timneh African Grey: `<img src="/emoji/cag-timneh.png" alt="Timneh African Grey" class="cag-emoji" loading="lazy">`
     - Large decorative (100px+): `<img src="/emoji/cag-congo.png" style="width:Xpx;height:Xpx;object-fit:contain;" alt="" loading="lazy">` — match original font-size value
     - Plain text / email / JS string contexts: use `[CAG]` or `[TAG]` as text markers — HTML img not possible in strings
8. **Anti-copy:** NEVER add `user-select: none` CSS or JS.
9. **Infographic widths:** `760px` wrapper for species guides / blogs / care pages; `1100px` wrapper for homepage / location pages / hero sections. Height always `400px` fixed on desktop, `auto` on mobile. Never use `900px` or `max-w-4xl` — those are legacy values. See `docs/reference/page-width.md §Infographic Width Rules`.

### Component Library v2

Full registry: `docs/reference/components.md` — 24 named components, each with 2–3 variants.

**Agent workflow for any page section build:**
1. Identify sections needed (hero, trust, FAQ, CTA, etc.)
2. Select 1–3 candidate components per section from the registry
3. **Show the user** candidates + variant options — a short text description is sufficient
4. **Wait for user approval** before writing any component code into a page
5. Implement only the approved component + variant

**Key components by use case:**

| Use Case | Component | Top Variants |
|---|---|---|
| Page hero | `cag-hero-v1`, `cag-split-hero` | v1 desktop, v2 alt, `editorial` Astro |
| Credibility strip | `cag-stats-bar` | `classic`, `dark` |
| Trust credentials | `cag-trust-stats` | `classic` |
| Bird listing | `cag-bird-card` | `classic`, `horizontal`, `feature` |
| Breeding pair | `cag-parent-birds` | `classic` |
| Pricing | `cag-pricing-table` | `classic`, `matrix` |
| Care tips | `cag-care-grid` | `classic` |
| Feature / why us | `cag-split-feature` | `editorial` |
| Scam content | `cag-scam-awareness` | `checklist`, `compare` |
| FAQ | `cag-faq-accordion` | `classic`, `editorial` |
| Long-form nav | `cag-toc-v1`, `cag-toc-v2` | v1 minimal, v2 bordered |
| Article callout | `cag-key-takeaway` | — |
| Sidebar full | `cag-toc-keytakeaway` | — combined |
| Inquiry form | `cag-contact-form` | `classic`, `application` |
| Newsletter | `cag-newsletter` | `banner`, `split` |
| Reviews | `cag-testimonials` | `grid`, `feature` |
| Footer | `cag-footer` | `dark` (default) |

### Page Width System — Option A (Classic 1200px)

Full spec: `docs/reference/page-width.md`

**Container rules — enforced on every page:**
- **All pages:** outer shell `max-width: 1200px` (`.container` class)
- **Informational / long-form pages:** inner text wrapper `max-width: 760px` (`.container-text` class)
- **All `<p>` tags:** `max-width: 70ch` — prevents unreadable long lines on wide screens

**Page type → container assignment:**
- Visual / transactional (homepage, bird listings, location pages): `.container` 1200px, full-width grids
- Informational (scam guide, care guides, species guides, blog): `.container` outer + `.container-text` 760px inner

**Breakpoints:**
- Desktop ≥1025px: 1200px centered, 48px padding
- Tablet 768–1024px: fluid 90–94%, 32px padding
- Mobile ≤767px: fluid 92%, 16px padding

**Responsive typography:** When writing or updating page CSS, apply the scale from `docs/design.md` §Responsive Typography Scale. Body line-height 1.6–1.7. No inline styles overriding the scale.

**Never** hard-code `max-width: 1180px` — use `1200px` or `var(--container)`.

**Infographic widths (confirmed defaults — applies to all `@cag-infographic-builder` output):**

| Page type | Wrapper max-width | Desktop height |
|---|---|---|
| Species guide, blog, care guide, article | **760px** | 400px fixed |
| Homepage, location pages, hero sections | **1100px** | 400px fixed |
| Mobile (≤767px for 1100px; ≤640px for 760px) | 100% width | auto (stacks) |

## Active Session — Homepage REBUILD v2 (2026-05-29 PM)
- v1 build used OLD/inline components + skipped the SEO checklist → full section-by-section rebuild.
- **LOCKED:** Hero B Authority Green · `cag-toc-v3:02` Grouped-by-part · `cag-key-takeaway-v2:02` Stat-forward grid ·
  Compare Table Style E (1100px) · new Mark & Teri owner card · new counter snippet
  (12+ Yrs aviary / 100% CITES / $1,500 Floor price / 24h) · new filterable BirdCard.
- **Content contract:** "C.A.Gs" / "C.A.Gs – Midland, TX" brand voice (never "congoafricangreys.com") ·
  ALL of H1–H6 used · every header conversational/Quora-style (What/How/Is/Can) · EBP framework per paragraph ·
  internal+external links woven mid-sentence (never at end) · PAA-only FAQs · `assets/brand/` shipping photos ·
  CITES Appendix I + captive-bred-USA · 8–15 top states/cities in shipping.
- **MANDATORY:** `MANUAL SEO CHECKLIST-HOMEPAGE.md` + `skills/cag-seo-master-checklist.md` — not optional.
- **AEO/GEO gate runs ON the page:** keyword-verifier → meta-description → trust-signals.
- Desktop renders new desktop components; mobile/tablet renders new mobile components.
- Governance docs reconciled to v2 (2026-05-29): `components.md`, `component-page-matrix.md`, `component-themes.md`
  now register the new bundles and route the homepage to them.
- Status: **DONE and LIVE** (2026-06-01). Homepage fully built + deployed — `src/pages/index.astro` (989 lines), 24 H2 sections live. Per "Always commit + push after build", all work committed + pushed.
- **Progress: COMPLETE.** All sections built, approved, and live. (The earlier "RESUME AT SECTION 9" note is superseded — homepage was finished after 2026-05-29.)
- Added `--color-panel/line/mid/forest` to `global.css` (fixed undefined cag-library tokens site-wide) + Rule 28b (Two-Keyword Headers) to the SEO checklist.
- **Continuation handoff:** `sessions/2026-05-29-homepage-build-progress.md` (read first next session; do NOT re-run grill-me).
- Session brief: `sessions/2026-05-29-session-brief.md` (see "REBUILD v2" section).

## Known Issues
- Homepage Video section: using a YouTube **placeholder** (embed + VideoObject schema scaffold) — breeder to supply the real URL later.
- Homepage `.mov` clip not browser-usable (ffmpeg/cwebp not installed to convert → mp4).
- GSC not connected → `docs/reference/top-pages.md` has no live clicks/impressions/LLM Visibility yet.
- MFS deploy may be broken — the shared "MFS Dashboard" GitHub PAT was deleted during CAG token rotation (2026-06-01). Run `git push --dry-run` in the MFS repo before next MFS work; it needs its own token. (CAG uses the new "CAGs-Website Workflow" PAT in keychain; remote is tokenless.)
