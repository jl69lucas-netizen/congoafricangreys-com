"""One screen: is the quality loop closing, and what should be fixed next?

    python3 scripts/quality_report.py

Sections:
  1. Rework rate, current window and delta          (the lagging indicator)
  2. First-run defects per page, by family          (the leading indicator)
  3. Worst family                                   (the next-action list)
  4. Open overrides                                 (suppressed defects, counted)
  5. Rules with no backing test                     (the deletion-candidate list)

Section 5 is the one that makes "no test, no rule" real. Everything else is
reporting; that section is enforcement.
