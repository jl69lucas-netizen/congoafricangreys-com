"""board_gate.py <slug> [--release]
The Page Board gate: refuses to build (or release) a page whose board.json is not
approved as it stands. Reads live headings from dist/ (build first). Exit 1 on any FAIL,
exit 2 when the record itself cannot be read or the invocation is wrong.
Prints its examined counts — a gate that examines nothing is not a pass
