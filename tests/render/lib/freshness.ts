 * A stale `dist/` is the quietest way this harness can lie: every check passes, every

 * Note on what this does NOT catch: deleting a source file (e.g. removing
 * `src/pages/foo/index.astro`) is invisible here — `newest()` only reads file mtimes,
 * so removing a file leaves every surviving file older than `dist/`, and the gate
 * reports fresh while `dist/foo/index.html` still serves a page whose source is gone.
 * Folding directory mtimes into the comparison would catch that, but was deliberately
 * rejected: directory mtimes are noisy (an editor swap file or a tool's temp file
 * appearing and vanishing under src/ bumps its parent directory's mtime), and on this
 * codebase a false REFUSAL is the more expensive failure mode — a gate that cries wolf
 * once gets ignored forever, which is how twelve gates accumulated false reports here.
 * A rare false PASS on a deleted-but-not-replaced source file is the accepted trade.
 * In practice the blind spot is narrower than it reads: a `git checkout` that removes
 * a file almost always rewrites others in the same commit with a current mtime, which
 * trips the gate anyway — the gap is specifically a file deleted with nothing else
 * in `src/` touched.
 *
 * CLOSED 2026-08-01, and NOT by folding directory mtimes in — that would have bought
 * the deletion case at the price of firing on unrelated filesystem noise, which is the
 * trade rejected above. `builtRoutesWithoutSource()` compares the SET of built routes
 * against the SET of source pages instead, so a failure always names the exact orphaned
 * route and is always actionable. The paragraph above is left standing because the
 * reasoning in it is still correct about mtimes; it is the mechanism that changed.
