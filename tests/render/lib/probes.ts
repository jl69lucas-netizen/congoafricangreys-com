 * 1. MUST SCROLL FIRST. A rail with `top: var(--hdr)` is not pinned at
 *    scrollY 0 — measured at rest it sits at top:1030, far down the document.
 *    Measuring without scrolling returns 96 (header only) and misses a 55px
 *    rail, so anchor targets landing *behind the rail* score as correct.
 * 2. MUST ACCUMULATE. Chrome stacks: the header pins at 0, the rail pins at
 *    the header's bottom. A `box.top <= 2` filter sees only the header. The
 *    band is grown iteratively — absorb anything whose top touches the band
 *    so far, and repeat until nothing more is absorbed.

  //
  // 1. ONE SAMPLE AT 1.5 VIEWPORTS IS NOT DEEP ENOUGH. The jump rails on the for-sale
  //    pages sit 1300-2000px down the document, past 1.5 viewports at 375 and 768.
  //    dna-tested and hand-raised measured 96px (header only) while their real chrome
  //    is 147px and 158px — so every landing was judged against a band 51-62px too
  //    high, and two pages were reported as defective when their CSS was correct.
  //    This is the second time this probe has been too shallow: it originally measured
  //    at scrollY 0, and 1.5 viewports was the fix. A fixed offset is the wrong shape.
  //
  // 2. `scrollBy` MADE THE ANSWER DEPEND ON CHECK ORDER. pages.spec shares ONE page
  //    object across every check, so this probe ran from whatever scroll position the
  //    previous check left behind and added 1.5 viewports to it. The same page measured
  //    96 or 158 depending purely on what ran before it, which made the band that judges
  //    every NAV landing non-deterministic across runs. `scrollTo` is absolute, so the
  //    incoming scroll position cannot influence the result.
  //
  // The maximum is the right reducer, not the last or the deepest sample: the band-grow
  // below only admits elements contiguous from the viewport top, so a band of 158 means
  // header AND rail were pinned SIMULTANEOUSLY at that depth. Chrome is "the most that
  // can be pinned at once". Neither a fixed offset nor scroll-to-bottom can find that —
  // at the document end a sticky element whose parent has ended has already un-stuck.
