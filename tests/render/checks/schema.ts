/**
 * The SCHEMA family reads the page's JSON-LD from the RENDERED document, then compares it
 * against what the page actually shows. That comparison is the reason these four checks
 * belong in the render harness rather than in a source grep:
 *
 *  - `schema-no-visible-date` is a statement about rendered TEXT, and the site's own schema
 *    is full of dates. A source grep for a date pattern reads the JSON-LD block and reports
 *    the page for the very node the rule mandates. innerText excludes <script> content, so
 *    measuring the painted page is what makes the check possible at all.
 *  - `schema-sold-not-instock` is schema-versus-rendered-state drift by definition.
 *
 * Extraction walks @graph, arrays, and nested values, because `@type` appears at every depth
 * on this site (a CollectionPage whose `about` is a Product whose `mainEntity` is an
 * ItemList). The four false-positive traps recorded in skills/manual-auditor-check.md all
 * come from pattern-matching the JSON text instead of parsing it; nothing here matches text.
