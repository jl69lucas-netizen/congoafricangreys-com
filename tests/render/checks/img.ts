     * flight at that cap and got reported as "failed to decode" — wording that reads as
     * a 404. It failed at vp375 only, because `sizes` resolves to ~170px there and that
     * is the sole viewport selecting the 230w candidate; the same page passed at 768 and
     * 1280 in the same run. The file was valid the whole time (6,294-byte WebP, decodes
     * to 230x144). reference_same_input_different_verdict.
