/**
 * RENDER_OVERRIDE=$'check-id:reason\nother-check:reason'  (one per line)
 *
 * An override suppresses a blocking failure and is written into the scorecard,
 * so overrides are counted rather than hidden. A bare id with no reason is rejected.
 *
 * Entries are separated by NEWLINES, and this is the third separator tried.
 * Commas failed first: "card srcset regen queued, see backlog" split into two
 * entries, the second having no colon. Semicolons were chosen as the fix and
 * failed the very first time a real override was written, on 2026-08-01, for
 * exactly the same reason — the reason prose contained a semicolon.
 *
 * The lesson is not "pick rarer punctuation." It is that ANY character common
 * in English prose will eventually appear in a reason, and each time it does
 * the override is rejected at the moment someone is trying to use it. A reason
 * nobody can write is an override nobody will use, and an override nobody will
 * use gets replaced by someone quietly flipping the check back to advisory,
 * which is the outcome this whole mechanism exists to prevent. A newline cannot
 * appear by accident in a shell-set value, so the escape hatch stops fighting
 * the prose it was built to carry.

/**
 * resetRaw() and writeManifest() used to live here at module scope and that was
 * wrong: Playwright loads this module once per WORKER PROCESS, not once per run, so
 * a destructive resetRaw() at this scope deleted earlier workers' already-written
 * partials out from under them (reproduced 2026-08-01 — see global-setup.ts for the
 * full account). Both now run exactly once, in the main process, from
 * global-setup.ts, before any worker spawns.
 *
 * The freshness beforeAll below is DIFFERENT and correctly stays here: it only
 * reads (checkDistFreshness has no destructive side effect), so re-running it once
 * per worker is harmless — every worker reaches the same true/false answer. It is
 * deliberately NOT in global-setup.ts, because that file is shared with
 * meta.spec.ts (globalSetup fires for every invocation of the config, meta-only
 * included), and meta.spec.ts must keep running while dist/ is stale or missing —
 * it tests the checkers against static fixtures, never against dist/ itself.
 *
 * A throwing beforeAll fails every test in this file, so no partial is written, so
 * build_scorecard.mjs Guard 1 (partials !== manifest) also fails. That cascade is
 * deliberate: a stale measurement must be loud at both ends, never a green run.
